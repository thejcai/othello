Group member contributions:

Both group members worked together on the simplest AI and then also on the original heuristic function. We talked through the logic and coded it together. Then Rafa implemented the minimax algorithm. Jesse modified Rafa's minimax algorithm and added alpha beta pruning and a square weight table. 

AI improvements:

We made a number of improvements to our AI. 

	1) We modified our minimax to go to a depth of four rather than two.

	2) We added alpha-beta pruning to make the minimax algorithm execute faster.

	3) We added a weight table to improve our heuristic. 

All of these adjustments contribute to increasing our AI's chances of selecting a stronger move than other AIs. (1) allows us to consider more cases and calculate deeper, (2) ensures (1) gets done in time, and (3) improves our evaluation of the board state. So, we think these adjustments will help us be successful.
